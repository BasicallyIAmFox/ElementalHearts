Elemental Hearts is a mod which adds a ton of new consumable items which increase your health (Like life crystals). They are based on all of the basic elements, (blocks, ores, etc.).

As with all of my mods, I prefer quality of quantity. This mod is a great addition to any modded playthrough, which adds a use for all of your leftover/extra blocks and ores.
This mod spreads with progression, so that you can never become too powerful.
